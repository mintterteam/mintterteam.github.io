## Tech Stack

We are building an application, a protocol, and a decentralized network for content creation and publishing. We use [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to build our protocol and decentralized network. We have significant inspirations from [SSB](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), [Dat](https://dat.foundation/), [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent), and other P2P protocols. The backend is in Go. Frontend is in TypeScript with React. For the Editor, we are using [Slate JS](https://docs.slatejs.org/).
