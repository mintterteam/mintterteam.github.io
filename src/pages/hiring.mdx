## Tech Stack

We are building an application, a protocol, and a decentralized network for content creation and publishing. We use libp2p and IPFS to build our protocol and decentralized network. 

We have significant inspirations from SSB, Dat, BitTorrent, and other P2P protocols. We like the great possibilities of the gossip protocol together with the nature of social connections.

The backend is in Go. The frontend is in TypeScript with React, and for the Editor, we are using Slate JS.
