We have significant inspirations from [SSB](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), [Dat](https://dat.foundation/), [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent), and other P2P protocols. The backend is in Go. Frontend is in TypeScript with React. For the Editor, we are using [Slate JS](https://docs.slatejs.org/).

- You love React
- You do whatever it takes to complete the tasks you agreed to with your team. Really, Whatever it takes!

- You feel uncomfortable shipping code that is not tested. You force yourself to test the critical logic
- You love ASTs and unified
