A Collaborative Publishing Platform, where the author creates and distributes content in direct person to person connections without a Gatekeeper. The author writes better content, other users collaborate better with the content, and the readers learn more. Furthermore, thanks to our cryptographic approach your audience engages with your content, keeping your authorship and royalties.

(in a **gossip protocol** through the social/user/personal connections.)We are a small team of 3 founders with a strong vision and very execution-oriented. We work remotely. We work asynchronously. We use new technologies. We want to solve the problem.

## Purpose

Augment our collective intellect through better trust-less collaboration among experts by providing a better tool to authors, publishers, and readers. Humans need better collaboration tools to solve more and more complex problems.

## Problem to Solve

An example of *How does the world of publishing work nowadays?*:

An epidemiologist expert writes an article about COVID in your City's Online Newspaper. Many people will read it. Some trolls will comment on the article, and some others will share it through a Messenger App leading to heated conversations. The expert's knowledge will start fading away slowly, without any educative reviews, challenging responses, or other informative perspectives. No one will learn anything—neither the policymakers, the population, nor the author. The article will become another failed opportunity as a society to solve a complex problem.

The goal of the current tools is to play with our emotions. The Public Sphere is just a Platform for Advertising, instead of a Platform for Dialogue. Conversations are fragmented, divisive, and lead us to yell at each other, fake news, and silence from the real experts. The Social Dialogue that brings learning and progress to society is not possible wit0h the current digital tools.

## Experimentation

We believe that better tools for better Social Dialogue are possible. We believe that most of the solutions to this problem already exist. We need to put them in place! We need to look into the first Visionaries of the 60s, the cryptographers mailing list, the p2p community, or the local first crew.

We are a highly experimental Company. These are our main areas of experimentation:

- We are experimenting with a better hypertext system deeply inspired by Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson.
- We are developing a citing system based on cryptography and distributed systems.
- We foresee Lightning Network as the enabler of a fair royalty system.
