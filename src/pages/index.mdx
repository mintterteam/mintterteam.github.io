title: 'We are Mintter'
---
Mintter is a peer to peer collaborative publishing platform. Authors create and distribute content via direct person to person connections without any central servers. It is a new distribution channel that you control without Gatekeepers.

We have improved hypertext authoring with content graphs, bidirectional linking, or visible connections. It is easier for Authors to write and publish content, other Authors can rapidly collaborate with it, and Readers learn more through different perspectives and contexts.

One more thing, thanks to our cryptographic approach, it is possible to reuse content keeping authorship and royalties.

## Purpose

Augment our collective intellect through better trust-less collaboration among experts by providing a better tool to Authors, Publishers, and Readers. Humans need better collaboration and thought tools to solve more and more complex problems.

## Problem to Solve

An example of how does the world of publishing work nowadays:

An epidemiologist expert writes an article about COVID in your City's Online Newspaper. Many people will read it. Some trolls will comment on the article, and some others will share it through a Messenger App leading to heated conversations.

The expert's knowledge will start fading away slowly, without any educative reviews, challenging responses, or other informative perspectives. No one will learn anythingâ€”neither the policymakers, the population, nor the author. The article will become another failed opportunity as a society to solve a complex problem.

Actual content companies' goal, basically social media or click-bait media, is to play with our emotions. The Public Sphere is just a Platform for Advertising instead of a Platform for Dialogue. Conversations are fragmented, divisive, and plagued with fake news that leads us to yell at each other.

The worst is the silence from the real experts, that run away from all the noise. The Social Dialogue that brings learning and progress to society is not possible with the current digital tools.

## Experimentation

The good news is that better tools for a better Social Dialogue are possible. Most of the solutions to this problem already exist. A long list of visionaries has procured us with them, starting with Vannevar Bush's article [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/), in 1945.

We need to put them in place! We need to look into the first Visionaries of the 50s and 60s, the cryptographers mailing list, the p2p community, or the local-first crew.

In Mintter, we love to go through this history of tools for thought. These are our main areas of experimentation:

- We are experimenting with a better hypertext authoring system deeply inspired by Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson.
- We are developing a citing system based on cryptography and distributed systems.
- We foresee Lightning Network as the enabler of a fair royalty system.

## Tech Stack

We are building an application, a protocol, and a decentralized network for content creation and publishing. We use libp2p and IPFS to build our protocol and decentralized network. 

We have significant inspirations from SSB, Dat, BitTorrent, and other P2P protocols. We like the great possibilities of the gossip protocol together with the nature of social connections.

The backend is in Go. The frontend is in TypeScript with React, and for the Editor, we are using Slate JS.

## Who are we
We are a team of three founders, [@hhg2288](), [@burdiyan](), and [@GaboHBeaumont](). We are passionate about innovation, social progress, and open protocols.

Previously, we have created socks, advertising, solar, and sustainable mobility companies. We are committed to many open-source software projects, education, and mentoring.

We work remotely, and we came from distant places in the world: Iberia, Siberia, and Central America. We are always looking for nomads all over the world to become part of the Mintter Revolution. 

## Building a Team
We are a small team with a strong vision and highly execution-oriented. We work remotely and asynchronously. We are technologists, always fascinated by the lasts technologies out there.

We are building a team, looking for people that share our Vision and our strong feeling of Purpose in improving trust-less social collaboration. If you feel inspired with our mission, please, we would love you to contact us. Currently, [We are hiring!](/hiring)
