Authors create and distribute content via direct person to person connections without any central servers. It is a new distribution channel that you control without Gatekeepers.</p><p>We improve hypertext authoring with content graphs, bidirectional linking, and visible connections. It is easier for Authors to write and publish content alone or in effortless collaboration with other Authors while Readers learn more through different perspectives and contexts.</p><p>Our cryptographic approach makes it possible to effortlessly reuse content while preserving authorship and collecting royalties.</p><h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2><p>Augment our collective intelligence through better trust-less collaboration among experts by providing a better tool to Authors, Publishers, and Readers. Humans need better collaboration and thought tools to solve ever more complex problems.</p><h2 id="problem-to-solve">Problem to Solve</h2><p>The goal of actual content companies, basically social media or click-bait media, is to play with our emotions to keep us connected. The Public Sphere is just a Platform for Advertising instead of a Platform for Dialogue. Conversations are fragmented, divisive, and plagued with fake news that leads us to yell at each other.</p><p>An example of how the world of publishing works nowadays:</p><p>An epidemiologist expert writes an article about COVID in your city&#x27;s online newspaper. Many people will read it. Some trolls will comment on the article, and some others will share it through a messenger app igniting a heated conversations.</p><p>The expert&#x27;s knowledge will start fading away slowly, without any educative reviews, challenging responses, or other informative perspectives. No one will learn anything—neither the policymakers, the population, nor the author. The article will become another failed opportunity as a society to solve a complex problem.</p><p>The main drawback is the actual experts silence that shy away from all the noise. The Social Dialogue that brings learning and progress to society is not possible with the current digital tools.</p><h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2><p>The good news is that things can be remedied by better tools for a better Social Dialogue. Many solutions to this problem have already been proposed by a long list of Visionaries of the 20th century, arguably starting with Vannevar Bush&#x27;s article As We May Think, published in 1945.</p><p>We need to put them in place! We need to look into the first Human-Computer Interaction Pioneers of the 50s and 60s, the hypertext hype of the 80s, Usenet, BBSs, the cryptographers mailing list, the p2p community, or the local-first crew.</p><p>In Mintter, we love to sieve through this history of tools searching for precious grains of wisdom projecting them onto today’s world’s problems and letting them drive our research and experimentation. For instance we are:</p><ul><li>experimenting with a better hypertext authoring system deeply inspired by Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson.</li><li>developing a citing system based on cryptography and distributed systems.</li><li>foreseeing Lightning Network as the enabler of a fair royalty system.</li></ul><h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2><p>We are building an application, a protocol, and a decentralized network for content creation and publishing for which we lean heavily on libp2p and IPFS.</p><p>We derive significant inspirations from SSB, Dat, BitTorrent, and other P2P protocols. We like the great possibilities of the gossip protocol together with the nature of social connections.</p><p>The backend is in Go. The frontend is in TypeScript with React, and for the Editor, we are using Slate JS.</p><h2 id="who-are-we">Who are we</h2><p>We are a team of three founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/hhg2288">@hhg2288</a>, <a href="">@burdiyan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GaboHBeaumont">@GaboHBeaumont</a>. We are passionate about innovation, social progress, and open protocols.</p><p>Previously, we have created socks, advertising, solar, and sustainable mobility companies. We are committed to many open-source software projects, education, and mentoring.</p><p>We work remotely, and we come from distant places in the world: Iberia, Siberia, and Central America. We are always looking for nomads all over the world to become part of the Mintter Revolution. </p><h2 id="building-a-team">Building a Team</h2><p>We are a small team with a strong vision and highly execution-oriented. We work remotely and asynchronously. We are technologists, always fascinated by the latest technologies out there.</p><p>We are building a team, looking for people that share our Vision and our strong feeling of Purpose in improving trust-less social collaboration. If you feel inspired by our mission, please, we would love you to contact us.
